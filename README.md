# Car Price Prediction Model ðŸš—ðŸ’°

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a car based on various features like the car make, year of manufacture, and mileage. The model is built using Python, and a user-friendly interface is provided using Streamlit.

  ## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for building the model and the Streamlit web application.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework used to create the interactive web application.
- **scikit-learn**: A powerful machine learning library used for training the model (RandomForestRegressor).
- **pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library used to handle the dataset.
- **pickle**: A Python library used to serialize and save the trained machine learning model for deployment.
- **GitHub**: Platform for hosting and sharing the code and the trained model.
- **Streamlit Cloud**: A platform for deploying and hosting the web app online.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Optimization**: Further optimization of the model using techniques like Hyperparameter Tuning or trying different algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting or XGBoost) for better accuracy.
- **Additional Features**: Including more car features such as location, car condition, or market demand to improve the accuracy of price predictions.
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrating real-time data updates for car prices using APIs from car listing platforms to keep the model up to date.
- **User Authentication**: Adding user login functionality for saving and retrieving previously predicted car price data.
- **Better UI/UX**: Enhancing the user interface to make it more intuitive, with features like dropdowns, sliders, and real-time feedback.
- **Mobile App**: Creating a mobile version of the web app to provide users with easy access to car price predictions on the go.
